# Provenance convention

Shared across this portfolio. Every computed artifact carries a manifest
binding it to the code, config, and inputs that produced it. The manifest
is part of the result, written next to outputs and embedded in API
responses. It is not a log line.

## Manifest schema

```json
{
  "schema": "provenance/v1",
  "created_utc": "ISO-8601 Z",
  "git": {"sha": "<40-hex>", "dirty": false},
  "package_versions": {"<dist>": "<version>"},
  "tool": "<engine or pipeline name>",
  "config_sha256": "<64-hex or null>",
  "input_sha256": {"<path>": "<64-hex>"},
  "output_sha256": {"<path>": "<64-hex>"}
}
```

## Rules

- Hashes are SHA-256 hex digests of file bytes. Directory inputs hash as
  the sha256 of the sorted `relpath:filehash` manifest of their files.
- `git.dirty` is recorded, never hidden; dirty runs are still provenance.
- `config_sha256` covers the parsed config object (canonical JSON with
  sorted keys), not the file bytes, so formatting changes do not churn it.
- Missing inputs are omitted from `input_sha256`, not zeroed.
- `output_sha256` may be added after writing outputs; the manifest is
  rewritten once, then treated as immutable.
- Verification recomputes the hashes and compares. It never trusts
  stored values.

## Implementations

Reference helper `provenance.py` is vendored per-repo (same bytes in
each adopting repo) and emits schema `provenance/v1`.
oncology-coscientist `oncocs/evidence.py` and dockops
`src/dockops/provenance.py` predate the convention and implement the
same binding discipline (git state, input/config/output hashes,
verification by recomputation) in their own formats; they are not
retrofitted with the v1 tag since their formats are hash-pinned.
